Scripts for analysis and figures related to paper documenting
coupled carbon cycle in CESM2

intended workflow:

1) generate data catalog of model output with ./build_catalog.py

2) generate timeseries with ./gen_tseries.py
e.g.,
./gen_tseries.py --tseries_specs_fname tseries_specs_ocn.yaml --experiments esm-piControl

3) make figures with NotImplemented

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

caveats:

relies on https://github.com/matt-long/data-catalog
currently have copy of data_catalog.py and lib_data_catalog/cesm_definitions.yml
from that repo included in this repo
