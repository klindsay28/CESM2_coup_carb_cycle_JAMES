Scripts for analysis and figures related to paper documenting
coupled carbon cycle in CESM2

intended workflow:

1) generate data catalog of model output with ./build_catalog.py

2) call tseries_mod:tseries_get in the process of performing analysis and/or making figures

requested tseries will be generated on the fly if necessary, and stored into the directory tseries

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

caveats:

relies on https://github.com/matt-long/data-catalog
currently have copy of data_catalog.py and lib_data_catalog/cesm_definitions.yml
from that repo included in this repo

relies on climatology.compute_ann_mean from https://github.com/NCAR/esmlab
most recent esmlab tag that works is 6e89f2a

tseries computation uses dask_jobqueue.SLURMCluster, which works on NCAR/CISL dav machines, not cheyenne
It could be modified to detect cheyenne, and switch to dask_jobqueue.PBSCluster
